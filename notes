# might want to add diacritics 

# NOTES: 
# 1. To help prevent incorrect edits, e.g. when bayesian occurs in the journal name ``Bayesian Analysis''
# we may use address restriction to take care of this a la: /Sebastopol/s/CA/California/g
# which restricts the regex to only change CA to California on lines containing "Sebastopol" as well 
# can we use this by testing the google bibtex output to make sure the file is formatted to have on the same line the
# "title={}" command? so we would want e.g. /title/s/Bayesian/{B}ayesian/g 
#   

# TODO:
# 1. will need to brainstorm on some more examples 
# 2. also will want to develop test cases of bibtex 
# files to run the code on to check output 
# 3. 


# additional capitalizations not yet entered nor having bibtex entries
